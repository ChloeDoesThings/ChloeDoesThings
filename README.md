## Hello! I'm Chloe and I like coding different projects for games like Roblox.

### Q/A
What do you like to write your code in? - I like to use Lua (specifically for Roblox), C#, C++, and sometimes Java (I've made Minecraft clients in the past).

What are you known for? - I've made Roblox scripts such as Reflex Hub which are known to quite a few people. I also own Neutron Client (which is a Minecraft hacked client).

What are your pronouns? - I go by she/her, but you can call me anything you want I guess.

What are you working on now? - Mainly Reflex Hub (which is currently in its developer phase), and a brand new project called ChloeRT.
